### Known issues:
- Some weapons have some very obvious dоgshit compression, blame darsu for that
- About 95% of materials have been reworked so far, some unfinished
- Default AKM handguard looks ugly for technical reasons, use VPO handguards instead

### Included are the following packs:
- EFT Shared
- AK Platform
- AR15 + HK416
- AI AXMC
- M3Super90 + M9A3

## Disclaimer:
***don't re-upload this garbage, don't use parts of it, this is a very cheap solution and only works with EFT crap because everything is split into separate materials.*
If you got any questions - just ask me directly.**
